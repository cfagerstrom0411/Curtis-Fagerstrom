                , a blended service, offering the best of traditional and contemporary music. Note: During the winter months, the main front entrance (east doors) may not be fully accessible on heavy snow or icy days. In keeping with past years, we will not endeavour to shovel and salt the large expanse of stairs and walks. This is especially true with the recent rash of ice storms which cover the walks and steps with dangerous ice. Please use the east doors to the stairway or the addition entrance adjacent the church offices. Thank you for your assistance with this.</p>
