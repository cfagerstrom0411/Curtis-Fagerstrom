            <p class="section_description">Our History
                Introducing Concordia Lutheran Church: Concordia Lutheran Church was organized in 1904 and incorporated in 1906. Our history spans nearly the entire twentieth Century. We are grateful for the many years we have had to proclaim the Good News of Jesus Christ in the greater Akron area. As we approach the dawning of a new century for our congregation and a new millenium for the Christian Church we are excited about reaching a new generation of people with the Life changing message of Jesus Christ. Because God has given us a vision for the future, we at Concordia believe our best years are yet ahead. Church sociologists have reported that the life expectancy of a congregation is about 80 years. Like a business, a church has a discernable life cycle of birth growth maturity and the decline. For many decline leads to death. By the grace of God we have surpassed the 80 year mark. We have moved from decline to stability and now we are beginning to move from stability to growth and health. Why am I so confident that despite the decline, we can have a future that is more glorious than the past? Because Concordia Lutheran is a church that is Anchored to the Rock and geared to the Times. Our church is founded upon the unchanging word of God but has changed to meet the needs of people in a changing world. What we believe, teach and confess will never change, but how we "do business" will change. Our desire is to bring a changeless Christ to a changing world. The message of the Gospel has remained unchanged for 2000 years, however, the media through which it is communicated has changed. The internet is but the newest medium for communicating the changeless message of the Gospel. We are pleased to provide this Web Site as a means of introducing you to Concordia Lutheran Church. If you would like to learn more about our church or a life changing relationship with Jesus Christ, please e-mail us or call us, we would be delighted to hear from you. We invite you and your family to become a part of our growing church family.
